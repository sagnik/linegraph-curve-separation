## LineGraph Curve Separation

Input to this system is a SVG file for a line graph as produced by https://github.com/sagnik/svgimagesfromallenaipdffigures. The output is a set of SVG files, each corresponding to a curve. See
`src/test/resources/hassan-Figure-2` for an example.   

For the **big picture**, see http://personal.psu.edu/szr163/hassan/hassan-Figure-2.html.
